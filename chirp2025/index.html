            Welcome to the second <b>C</b>HI MNL Transforming <b>H</b>C<b>I</b>

          </h2>
          <p>
            This is the second CHI MNL Transforming HCI Research in the
            Philippines Workshop. The goal of this workshop is to establish,
            invigorate and encourage HCI research in the Philippines by
            researchers in the Philippines, and nearby regions. The workshop
            also aims to invite international collaborators to conduct research
            in and collaborate with researchers based in the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Co organized as part of the PCSC 2025 Conference, the workshop aims
            to catalyze and advance Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research in
            the Philippines by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange
            among researchers and practitioners. By bringing together diverse
            perspectives and experiences, we aim to explore innovative
            approaches and solutions to contemporary HCI challenges in the
            Philippine context. We invite early-career and experienced
            researchers alike who are interested in conducting HCI research in
            the Philippines.

          <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
          <p>
            We invite submissions that contribute to the advancement of HCI
            research in the Philippines. Submissions could fall under any of the
            two categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Regular Papers:</b> research or projects that are in a mature
              stage and present a contribution to HCI. Regular papers usually
              present an exploration, an artifact, a survey, a dataset,
              empirical studies or a combination of any of these. Regular Papers
              accepted in the CHIRP 2025 proceedings shall be submitted to
              CEUR-WS.org for online publication.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Works-in-Progress (WIP) and Interactive Demos:</b> WIP papers
              are ongoing research or projects exploring novel interface
              projects applicable in the Philippine setting, aiming to present
              preliminary findings and seek feedback for further refinement and
              development. WIP papers are suited for showcasing BSc and MSc
              students&apos; work. Demo papers showcase tangible implementations
              or prototypes of HCI-related technologies or systems, allowing
              participants to engage directly with the presented concepts,
              interfaces, or functionalities, fostering hands-on exploration and
              discussion during the workshop. WIP and Demo papers shall be
              included in the CHIRP 2025 adjunct proceedings which will be
              submitted to arXiv and in the conference website.

              <h4>Anonymity</h4>
              <p>
                We will adopt a flexible anonymity policy, allowing authors to
                decide what information to reveal. The CMT submission system
                will be set to double-blind, meaning reviewers will not see
                author names unless they are included in the paper. Therefore,
                authors can choose to disclose their identity in the submitted
                PDF (resulting in a single-blind review) or keep it anonymous
                (maintaining a double-blind process).

              <h4>Review Process</h4>
              <p>
                The CHIRP 2025 Workshop will follow a rigorous and constructive
                review process. Submissions will be evaluated through a
                <b>single-round, anonymous review,</b> where reviewers will
                assess the clarity, originality, relevance, and potential impact
                of the work. Each submission will receive feedback from at least
                two members of our program committee, aiming to provide authors
                with insightful and supportive comments. The PC is composed of
                members who specialize in HCI both in industry and academia. The
                review process is designed to be <b>mentorship-oriented,</b>
                encouraging emerging researchers and fostering discussions that
                refine and strengthen contributions. Final acceptance decisions
                will consider both reviewer feedback and the workshop&apos;s
                thematic fit, ensuring a diverse and engaging set of
                presentations.

              <h4>Presentation Format</h4>
              <p>
                Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop. At least one
                author of each paper must register in both the workshop and the
                PCSC 2025 conference. The expected presentation time for full
                paper is 10 min + 5 min for Q&A. WIP and Demo papers will have
                an opportunity to setup and present their posters/demos during
                the workshop. Participants of the workshop will also get a
                chance to present their work during the breaks of the workshop.
