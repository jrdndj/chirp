  <!-- <pre># Instructions for Table of Contents 
# The table of contents normally is a plain list of papers (with titles/authors).
# The paper title should be linked to the paper URL (usually pdf).
# You may include "session" subsections e.g. to reflect the track structure of your workshop.
# Authors should be specified as comma-separated lists with full author names
# (like John Smith). Avoid glue words like 'by' and 'and'. If applicable, then lookup how
# the author is spelled out by DBLP.
# You may also provide additional material such as preface, bibtex files, complete 
# proceedings as a single pdf, and similar items. The additional items should be 
# clearly separated from the paper list, preferably after the table of contents.
# Please only tag original papers with the title/author scheme. Rather do not tag
# additional material with this scheme!
# For the time being, presentation slides should also not be tagged by title/author.
#
# CEUR-WS shall watermark PDF files in a published volume by its online CEUR-WS.org URL.
# If there are certain PDF files like frontmatter or images that you like to exclude
# from watermarking, then give it a name like 'xfrontmatter.pdf'. 
#
# For all other PDF files, use functional names like
#   - paper1.pdf   (regular papers; start with paper1, then paper2,...)
#   - invited1.pdf  (invited paper)
#   - keynote1.pdf  (a variant for invited papers)
#   - short1.pdf   (a short paper that still is a citable paper)
#   - abstract1.pdf  (an abstract that is not supposed to be a citable paper)
#   - preface.pdf   (a preface, usually not citable)
# By default, all PDF files of a published volume will be watermarked by their online CEUR-WS URL.
# You can disable this by prefixing the filename with the letter 'x', see xpreface below.
#</pre> -->


  <div class="TOC">
    <h2> Table of Contents </h2>

    <!-- <pre># Prefaces, frontmatter etc. typically have no explicit authors.
# Note that the &lt;li id="..."&gt; attribute should have the same value as
# the name of the file linked to, just without the filename extension.
# This allows the table of contents entries to be linked to.
# If a preface has explicit authors and has the nature of a paper with
# more than 4-5 pages and a list of references, then use the CEUR tags like
# for regular papers.
# Please provide a summary sentence about the number of submitted and accepted papers. You can explain the peer-review
# process in more detail in the preface pdf file. You can change the precise wording of the sentence to adapt it to
# the context of your workshop/conference. The tags for REGULAR and SHORT papers are optional.
